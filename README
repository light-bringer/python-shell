How to use this :

1. Make sure you have Python2.7 installed
2. Check the file squid.conf.file and verify if this is the configuration you want
3. By default these two users are updated for Squid : //let me know if you want them to be modified and user taken input in future

    user1 - admin
    user2 - admin

             line 299   userdict = {'user1':'admin', 'user2':'admin'}
             line 300   squidconfig = "squid.conf.file"




4. if everything is Fine, just run bash setup.py and enjoy!


ps - Run the script as root user or sudo run it, else it will curse you! :D



for example : get the zip file in your system and run :
'''
sudo bash setup.sh
'''


or run after logging into the server as root user

'''
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/light-bringer/python-shell/master/setup.sh
sudo bash setup.sh
'''
