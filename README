How to use this : 

1. Make sure you have Python2.7 Enabled
2. Check the file squid.conf.file and verify if this is the configuration you want
3. open the setup.py and check in main function 
             line 299   userdict = {'user1':'admin', 'user2':'admin'}
             line 300   squidconfig = "squid.conf.file"


        if both of them are correct, if not update with your values, I will provide CMD Params support in future

4. if everything is Fine, just run python setup.py and enjoy!
